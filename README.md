## Overview

The goal of this project is for me to practice what I have learned in the Intermediate Python and Data Engineering chapter of the Ironhack program. For this project, I start with [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset). I import it and use my newly-acquired skills to build a data pipeline that processes the data and produces a result. I try demonstrate my proficiency with the tools we covered (functions, list comprehensions, string operations and web scraping) in my pipeline.
